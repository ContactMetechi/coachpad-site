        <h1>CoachPad Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>



        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <p>CoachPad (“app”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights in relation to it when you use our mobile application.</p>



        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>



        <h3>2.1. Information You Provide</h3>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you choose to create an account (via Email, Google Sign-In, or Apple Sign-In), we collect your email address and a unique user identifier. This is used solely for authentication and to enable cloud sync features.</li>

        </ul>



        <h3>2.2. User-Generated Content (Premium Users)</h3>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Tactics and Animations:</strong> If you are a logged-in Premium user, we collect the tactics and animations you create and choose to sync. This data is stored securely on our backend servers (Supabase) to provide backup and synchronization across your devices.</li>

        </ul>



        <h3>2.3. Information Collected Automatically</h3>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Local Usage Data:</strong> App preferences, settings, and any tactics/animations you create are stored locally on your device.</li>

            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect basic device information such as device model and operating system version for analytics and crash reporting.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> To authenticate your account, process your subscriptions, and (for Premium users) securely sync your tactics and animations.</li>

            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics to monitor app stability, detect crashes, and understand usage patterns to improve features.</li>

            <li><strong>To Display Advertisements:</strong> For non-Premium users, we display non-personalized ads using Google AdMob.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>4. Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> For all users, all tactics and animations are stored by default **locally on your device**.</li>

            <li><strong>Cloud Synchronization (Premium Feature):</strong> If you are a Premium user and logged in, your tactics and animations are also securely synchronized with our cloud backend (Supabase). **If you are not a Premium user or are not logged in, your data never leaves your device.**</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>5. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with the following third-party service providers who are essential for the app to function:</p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Our backend provider for user authentication (e.g., login) and cloud database (tactic/animation sync for Premium users).</li>

            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Displays non-personalized advertisements to non-Premium users.</li>

            <li><strong>Firebase (by Google):</strong> Provides app analytics and crash reporting to help us identify and fix bugs.</li>

            <li><strong>Google Play & Apple App Store:</strong> Process all in-app purchases and subscriptions. We do not handle or store your payment information.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>We may also disclose your information if required by law.</p>


        <h2>7. Your Rights and Data Deletion</h2>

        <p>You have control over your data in the following ways:</p>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> All tactics and animations stored locally on your device can be deleted at any time by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app.</li>

            <li><strong>Cloud Data & Account Deletion:</strong> If you have created an account, your account information (email) and any synced cloud data (tactics/animations) will remain on our servers even if you uninstall the app. **To request the permanent deletion of your account and all associated cloud data, please send an email to our support address.**</li>

            <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel your Premium subscription at any time through your Google Play Store or Apple App Store account settings.</li>

        </ul>
